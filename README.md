# Food-delivery-services
My project will assist people in getting food at their door steps without leaving their comfort zone, they would contact us at any time of the day to either deliver breakfast,brunch,lunch and dinner. Also they can send food across to their families,friends and love ones. Once they book a rider to make a delivery they are immediately sent the riders number for contact purposes incase they would like to add other items to the delivery,they can stay on the line or decide to chat the rider. 
They also have the option of asking for the menu of the restuarant they would like to order from so they can make an option on what to order. Our work is to help them order food from their comfort zone without any stress of any kind and its to reduce the hassel of thinking of the resturant to order from because we can also make recommendations of amazing resturants to order from.
